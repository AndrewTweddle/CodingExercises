# Rectangle of words

## The problem statement

Given a dictionary of millions of words, write code to find the largest possible rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom).

## Assumptions

1. Read the inputs from a text file with a separate word on each line
2. Assume ASCII (or UTF-8) inputs
3. Size is assumed to be the number of cells in the grid of letters i.e. rows x columns
4. It is sufficient to return the first rectangle found as long as it has the largest possible size (not every rectangle of this size, as there could be a great many).

## Source data

The following repository has a text file containing nearly half a million words: <https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/>.

## Prototypes

### Scala prototype (v1)

See: [source code](https://github.com/AndrewTweddle/CodingExercises/blob/master/misc/WordRectangles/Scala_v1/src/main/scala/com/andrewtweddle/wordrects/WordRectMain.scala)

#### Initial performance results

I set this running (albeit in debug mode) on my personal machine on a Sunday evening. It produced the following outputs and performance data over a number of day:

It ran for most of a day on the 10x10 grid size before the program was terminated.

#### Performance improvement opportunities

I chose to have fewer rows than columns for aesthetic reasons, so that solutions will fit on screen better. But later, when testing the C++ prototype, I found that performance is much better when row count > column count.

A better solution would be to build up the solution one row at a time, instead of one column at a time. It might also make it easier to track and report on strings found, instead of having a grid of characters.

But this is a prototype. It has served its purpose (for now). So I want to focus my effort on optimizing performance instead of cleaning up and improving this code.

### C++ Prototype (v1)

See: [source code](https://github.com/AndrewTweddle/CodingExercises/blob/master/misc/WordRectangles/Cpp_v1/main.cpp)

#### Initial experiment

Due to the long running times of some of the Scala rectangles, I decided to try a C++ solution next to see what impact this had on performance.

The C++ prototype doesn't try all grid sizes. Instead I hard-coded the row and column dimensions before running the code. This allowed me to compare performance on rectangle dimensions where I knew how long the Scala code had taken.

The C++ prototype only reports the first solution found. Whereas the Scala code returns multiple solutions of a particular size.

However the C++ prototype also counts the number of words of each length, and tracks the number of words in each branch of the trie.

#### Testing

On a 4x4 grid, the C++ prototype produces the following output:

```

I'm suspicious that the first solution found is not symmetric around the main diagonal. This could indicate a bug.

#### Performance

To my surprise the C++ code typically ran 2.5 to 3.5 times longer than the Scala code on rectangles of the same dimension.

For example, on a 14 x 14 grid, the Scala code took around 23 seconds...

```
  Grid size: 196
    14 x 14
        0 solutions found
        Search duration: 22914.9084 ms
```

But the C++ code took over 78 seconds...

        Search duration: 78651 ms

And on a 7 x 18 grid, the Scala algorithm took around 20 seconds...

```
    7 x 18
        0 solutions found
        Search duration: 20101.0267 ms
```

But the C++ algorithm took over 96 seconds, almost 5 times longer...

```

        Search duration: 96206 ms

#### Performance profiling

Change the C++ code to use a 7 x 20 grid, since this grid runs in around 0.5 seconds for the Scala solution...

```
    7 x 20
        0 solutions found
        Search duration: 512.55 ms
```

The C++ prototype takes around 1.6 seconds for this rectangle (and under 6 seconds in total)...

Then install valgrind tools...

```
$ sudo apt-get install valgrind
$ sudo apt-get install kcachegrind
```

Create a suitable directory to store the file generated by valgrind. Then profile the code:

```
valgrind --tool=callgrind /path/to/wordrect /path/to/english-words/words.txt
```

This produces the following output:

```

It took 5 minutes to run this.

Then use kcachegrind to view the performance profile...

```
$ kcachegrind callgrind.out.17455 &
```

Or view a text summary using:

```
$ callgrind_annotate callgrind.out.17455
```

ColumnSolver::solveCell() is called nearly 2 million times.
TrieNode::isIterEnded() is called over 19.5 million times.

If we look at the call graph for GridSolver::tryToSolveGrid(), we see the contribution of the red-black tree which the map data structure uses...

![Graph exported from kcachegrind](Cpp_v1/CallGrindGraph_CppV1.jpg)

My first aha moment was that the C++ solution uses a pair of iterators to find matching characters in the nodes of the row and column tries. This felt like a good idea at the time. But iterating through a red-black tree is probably quite expensive. By contrast the Scala code iterates through one TrieNode's sub-nodes, but looks up the characters in the other TrieNode's map. This might be much faster when there are few characters in common.

The second realization is that iterating through a pair of arrays or vectors of sub-nodes (ordered by character) would probably be quite efficient. The maps are useful for building up the tries. But they could be converted to a more streamlined trie structure once built.
