// If we want to find 3 primes (all 4 digits long) in an arithmetic sequence,
// then all 3 will be of the form 6n+1, or all 3 will be of the form 6n-1.
// Why? Well suppose i, j and k are the multiples of 6 in this representation of the 3 numbers.
// And suppose that r, s and t are the offsets (1 or -1) for each of them.
// Then: (6j+s) - (6i+r) = (6k+t) - (6j+s)
// Hence: 6k + t = 2(6j+s) - (6i+r) = 6(2j-i) + (2s-r)
