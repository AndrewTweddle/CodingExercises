# Overview

This project contains my solutions to various coding exercises.

I use these to:
* practise coding skills,
* learn new programming languages,
* compare languages or paradigms,
* prepare for technical interviews, and (last but **not** least)
* have fun solving coding puzzles!

Do binary search for integer square root based on lower and upper integer bounds. Still slow, even though int sqrt is outside the inner loop.                                                                         |

I had a brainwave! T(n) = n*(n+1)/2. n and n+1 are relatively prime. Hence # of divisors of T(n) is the product of # of divisors of n/2 and n+1 (if n is even) or n and (n+1)/2 if odd.                                 |

As above, but also pre-generate a few primes and further decompose each divisor by these primes before counting the # of divisors. 30 makes a good cut-off, so factorize up to 29.                                      |

As above, but hard-coding the primes up to 31, instead of calculating them on the fly.                                                                                                                                    |

As above, but only count divisors of the remainder (after reducing by primes up to 31) of the form 6q+1 or 6q+5.                                                                                                          |

As above, but only count divisors of the remainder (after reducing by small primes) of the form 30q+r for suitable r. This is slower for n=500, but scales well for much higher values.                                   |

Using hard-coded primes, with mpsc (5 threads works well on my PC). Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is much slower since we are not I/O bound. It catches up for very large n (> 10,000).                                  |

Instead of pre-computing or hard-coding primes, completely factorize into primes on the fly. Although slower, this solution is shorter and more elegant.                                                                |

Same algorithm, but using num crate's integer square root implementation instead of my own.                                                                                                                                 |

Three iterators were used, one for each value of n. The 3 iterators were moved ahead in unison to keep the 3 numbers (triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal) close together to find a match. |

Iterate over hexagonal numbers, using a formula to invert the pentagonal and triangular numbers. Slightly more succinct, but much slower than the previous solution.                       |

The same as my first solution, but using the fact that H(n) = T(2n-1), so the triangular numbers don't need to be iterated over. I had missed this, but it was pointed out on the forum.    |

## Advent of Code

### Learning by comparison

Many participants share their solutions on the reddit [AOC mega-thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/solution_megathreads).

This can be very useful for:
* Comparing solution approaches.
* Learning clever tricks and handy features of the language and libraries.
* Comparing readability of different coding styles and languages.
* Comparing performance of solutions.

## Functional Programming In Scala

Exercises from the book
["Functional Programming in Scala"](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/)
are in [a separate GitHub project](https://github.com/AndrewTweddle/fpinscala)
which was forked from [the original FPInScala repo](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala)
for the book.

# Learnings and notes

## General approach

_Note: This is the approach I was experimenting with in 2015. It can be quite onerous and slow (compared to a more intuitive approach)._

### Follow a miniaturised SDLC

* Analysis
  * Summarize the problem statement (preferably highlighting critical clauses)
  * Confirm the scope
  * Question the requirements
  * Look for simplifying assumptions
  * List any issues that complicate things (and consider unit testing these earlier)
* Design
  * Brainstorm a number of solutions
    * Count number of steps and estimate the big-O scalability of each
    * Decide which solution to implement
      * Check the stakeholder's preferences when there is a trade-off (e.g. speed versus maintainability)
      * Otherwise, favour clarity over cleverness
    * Look for utility methods which could be useful across multiple solutions
  * Do UML designs if necessary
  * Do pseudocode if useful
    * Be alert for useful utility methods to make the main algorithm more readable
* Code
  * If there are multiple algorithms to implement, create a base class and a derived class per algorithm
* Unit test
  * If there are multiple algorithms to test, create a base class and a derived unit test class per implementation
* Code review
  * Look at the code critically
  * Refactor, add TODO's or make a note of areas that could be improved
* Compare
  * If a commonly used Kata (e.g. the bowling game), see how others have solved it and compare to my solution

### Use a notebook to write all code on paper first

* Ideally I wanted to use my whiteboard for all steps in this mini SDLC, but it was already in use
* Instead, I used a notebook to do analysis, design, coding and unit testing
* Once done I would capture and compile the code and unit tests electronically
  * An exception was exercise 4.1, which I coded directly.
  * The quality of the code in this exercise is noticeably worse, so pre-planning on paper is clearly worthwhile
  * I was initially skeptical of doing whiteboard coding in interviews, as this is not common practice in South Africa
  * However, I am already seeing benefits from doing this:
    * Improved designs through adding greater structure and focus to the creative process
    * An improved ability to "play out" detailed coding scenarios in my head
* I then fixed coding errors or refactored the code and made notes on these errors and refactorings
* After each exercise I add any language-specific notes and reminders to the sections below

## Other coding tips

1. Whenever adding to an int, consider whether the expression should be in a checked block "{}" to catch overflows.
2. "for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)" - consider whether n could be int.MaxValue, which would cause overflow. If so, consider summing in reverse.

## General approach

1. When faced with a "monolithic method", consider applying separation of concerns, even if this causes some duplication or multiple passes through a (small) iteration.
2. In the above case, consider refactoring out smaller methods first, as this might reduce duplication.
