# Coding Exercises

## Overview

This project contains my solutions to various coding exercises.

These have been used to practise coding skills, learn new programming languages, compare languages and prepare for technical interviews.

# Different types of exercises

## CTCI

The CTCI sub-folder contain my solutions to exercises from the 5th edition of [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
