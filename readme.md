# Overview

This project contains my solutions to various coding exercises.

I use these to:
* practise coding skills,
* learn new programming languages,
* compare languages or paradigms,
* prepare for technical interviews, and (last but **not** least)
* have fun solving coding puzzles!

The same approach but using 4 nested loops over possible digits of a prime number, instead of iterating over numbers of the form 6k +/- 1 and then calculating digits.    |

Very similar to the previous solution. Logically, this *should* have made the code faster, since it's doing less. Instead it's worse! No point in further refactorings.   |

Use the second solution above, but once the cumulative sum exceeds 1 million, stop generating further primes. (Not my own idea: I saw this tip on the forum.)

Generate additional primes, so that the last T primes don't exceeed one million, where T is the number of terms in the initial best solution.

## Advent of Code

### Learning by comparison

Many participants share their solutions on the reddit [AOC mega-thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/solution_megathreads).

This can be very useful for:
* Comparing solution approaches.
* Learning clever tricks and handy features of the language and libraries.
* Comparing readability of different coding styles and languages.
* Comparing performance of solutions.

## Functional Programming In Scala

Exercises from the book
["Functional Programming in Scala"](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/)
are in [a separate GitHub project](https://github.com/AndrewTweddle/fpinscala)
which was forked from [the original FPInScala repo](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala)
for the book.

# Learnings and notes

## General approach

_Note: This is the approach I was experimenting with in 2015. It can be quite onerous and slow (compared to a more intuitive approach)._

### Follow a miniaturised SDLC

* Analysis
  * Summarize the problem statement (preferably highlighting critical clauses)
  * Confirm the scope
  * Question the requirements
  * Look for simplifying assumptions
  * List any issues that complicate things (and consider unit testing these earlier)
* Design
  * Brainstorm a number of solutions
    * Count number of steps and estimate the big-O scalability of each
    * Decide which solution to implement
      * Check the stakeholder's preferences when there is a trade-off (e.g. speed versus maintainability)
      * Otherwise, favour clarity over cleverness
    * Look for utility methods which could be useful across multiple solutions
  * Do UML designs if necessary
  * Do pseudocode if useful
    * Be alert for useful utility methods to make the main algorithm more readable
* Code
  * If there are multiple algorithms to implement, create a base class and a derived class per algorithm
* Unit test
  * If there are multiple algorithms to test, create a base class and a derived unit test class per implementation
* Code review
  * Look at the code critically
  * Refactor, add TODO's or make a note of areas that could be improved
* Compare
  * If a commonly used Kata (e.g. the bowling game), see how others have solved it and compare to my solution

### Use a notebook to write all code on paper first

* Ideally I wanted to use my whiteboard for all steps in this mini SDLC, but it was already in use
* Instead, I used a notebook to do analysis, design, coding and unit testing
* Once done I would capture and compile the code and unit tests electronically
  * An exception was exercise 4.1, which I coded directly.
  * The quality of the code in this exercise is noticeably worse, so pre-planning on paper is clearly worthwhile
  * I was initially skeptical of doing whiteboard coding in interviews, as this is not common practice in South Africa
  * However, I am already seeing benefits from doing this:
    * Improved designs through adding greater structure and focus to the creative process
    * An improved ability to "play out" detailed coding scenarios in my head
* I then fixed coding errors or refactored the code and made notes on these errors and refactorings
* After each exercise I add any language-specific notes and reminders to the sections below

| Hash maps                     | Dictionary&lt;K, V&gt;                                                   | Useful methods: ContainsKey, Keys, Values, enumerator over KeyValuePair&lt;K, V&gt;                                                                         |
| Test multiple implementations | MSTest: [TestMethod] on base class methods, [TestClass] on derived class | The derived unit test class chooses which implementation to use. The base class defines the common tests.                                                   |
| Assert.AreEqual               | Parameters: expected then actual                                         |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Int to binary string          | Convert.ToString(value, 2 )                                              | Useful for making unit test more readable. See [exercise 5.1](CTCI/CSharp/AndrewTweddle.CodingExercises.CTCI.Tests/Chapter5/Exercise1/WhenInsertingBits.cs) |
| Binary string to int          | Convert.ToInt32(str, 2 )                                                 | The second parameter is the base. See [exercise 5.1](CTCI/CSharp/AndrewTweddle.CodingExercises.CTCI.Tests/Chapter5/Exercise1/WhenInsertingBits.cs)          |
| Validate arguments            | ArgumentException(message, paramName )                                   | The parameter name is the second parameter to the constructor.                                                                                              |
| Validate argument range       | ArgumentOutOfRangeException(paramName, message)                          | But this time the parameter name is the first parameter to the constructor!                                                                                 |
| Overflow checking             | checked { ... }                                                          | Arithmetic overflow is silent unless the statement/s (NOT expressions) are in a checked block                                                               |
| Initialize dictionary         | ... = { {key; value}, ... }                                              |                                                                                                                                                             |

## Other coding tips

1. Whenever adding to an int, consider whether the expression should be in a checked block "{}" to catch overflows.
2. "for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)" - consider whether n could be int.MaxValue, which would cause overflow. If so, consider summing in reverse.

## General approach

1. When faced with a "monolithic method", consider applying separation of concerns, even if this causes some duplication or multiple passes through a (small) iteration.
2. In the above case, consider refactoring out smaller methods first, as this might reduce duplication.
