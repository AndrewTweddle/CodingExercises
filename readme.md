# Coding Exercises

## Overview

This project contains my solutions to various coding exercises.

These have been used to practise coding skills, learn new programming languages, compare languages and prepare for technical interviews.

# Different types of exercises

## CTCI

The CTCI sub-folder contain my solutions to exercises from the 5th edition of [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

| Exercise  | Description                              | My solutions  |

# Learnings and notes

## General approach

* Analysis
  * Question the requirements
  * Look for simplifying assumptions
* Design
  * Brainstorm a number of solutions
    * Count number of steps and estimate the big-O scalability of each
    * Decide which solution to implement
      * Check the stakeholder's preferences when there is a trade-off (e.g. speed versus maintainability)
      * Otherwise favour clarity over cleverness
    * Look for utility methods which could be useful across multiple solutions
  * Do UML designs if necessary
  * Do pseudocode if useful
    * Be alert for useful utility methods to make the main algorithm more readable
* Code
  * If there are multiple algorithms to implement, create a base class and a derived class per algorithm
* Unit test
  * If there are multiple algorithms to test, create a base class and a derived unit test class per implementation
* Code review
  * Look at the code critically
  * Refactor, add TODO's or make a note of areas that could be improved


## C\# 

| Purpose   | Solution              | Notes                      |
| ---       | ---                   | ---                        | 
| Sets      | HashSet&lt;T&gt;      | Useful methods: Add and Contains. |
| Hash maps | Dictionary&lt;K, V&gt;   | Useful methods: ContainsKey, Keys, Values, enumerator over KeyValuePair&lt;K, V&gt; |
| Test multiple implementations | MSTest: [TestMethod] on base class, [TestClass] on derived | The derived unit test class chooses which implementation to use. The base class defines the common tests. |
